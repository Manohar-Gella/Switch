ğŸ”´How to do computers work?
-> Intalled programms are stored in SSD
    when the program is opened they ran to RAM for processing
    when program opened binary is what hpenning insite of the RAM
-> Software is written in programming language
    Comilers conver high level program into low level code that computer can understand and computers only understand binary (0101010)


ğŸ”´What are compilers - Compilers convert high level developer friendly code into 0s and 1s

ğŸ”´ex: compiling C++ code
    g++ a.cpp temp
    ./temp

ğŸ”´diffrence btween compiled language and interpreted language

    ğŸ”´Compiled languages
    1. First need to compile, then need to run
    2. Usually donâ€™t compile if there is
    an error in the code
    3. Example - C++, Java, Rust, Golang 

    ğŸ”´Interpreted Languages
    1. Usually go line by line
    2. Can run partially if the error comes later
    3. Example - Javascript, Python

ğŸ”´Static vs dynamic Languages
    
    ğŸ”´Static - strict code
    ğŸ”´Dynamic - Can move fast easy to understand

ğŸ”´Js is Single threaded language
ğŸ”´Js Can only use one core at a time
ğŸ”´Js runs line by line
ğŸ”´Js can partially executed with eroors
